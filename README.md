# DesignerGame
App includes two games "Right on Target", where user must choose on slider the correct value, and "Select Color", where user must choose the color accodting it HEX-value. The app uses MVC and such base instruments as UIButton, UISlider and UIColor.
The main issue was creating one business logic for two quite different games. The solution was generics.
